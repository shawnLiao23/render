The above-given chart compares the population shares in a gamut of regions worldwide with the wealth distribution in these same regions. It is evident that wealth is heavily concentrated in Europe, North America, and high-income Asia-Pacific nations, which accounts for approximately 90% of global wealth.

Despite having around 6% of the worldâ€™s population, North America still boasts nearly 34% of the global wealth. An akin situation can be noticed in Europe, contributing 30% to the global wealth, even though its population is merely 15%. In terms of high-income Asia-Pacific nations, which have 5% of the worldwide population, the world gets 24% of its wealth.

In contrast, the all-inclusive share of wealth owned by people residing in India, China, Africa and other low-income nations in Asia is significantly less than their share of the population. Sometimes, it also goes down by a factor of more than ten. The situation is quite striking in India, where the population is 16% of the world, but the wealth is meagerly 1%. On the other hand, in China, which has the highest global population (24%), the wealth contribution is only 3%.

Overall, the statistics of the world population seem to be inverse in proportion to wealth distribution. If the former is higher, the latter is possibly lower.
