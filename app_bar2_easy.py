                    The bar chart illustrates the average number of leisure hours per week enjoyed by men and women in different employment categories in the years 1998–1999. The categories include full-time employment, part-time employment, unemployment, retirement, and housewives.
Overall, men tended to have more leisure time than women in most employment statuses. However, data for part-time workers and housewives is only available for females.
Among the unemployed and retired, both men and women enjoyed the most leisure time, with unemployed men averaging around ____ hours per week, slightly more than unemployed women at approximately ___ hours. A similar pattern is seen among the retired group, with men enjoying about ___ hours and women around 78 hours.
_____ employed men had around ___ hours of leisure time, compared to about 38 hours for women in the same category. Women working part-time had approximately 40 hours of free time, while housewives had even more, averaging ___ hours per week.
In conclusion, those who were not working (either unemployed or retired) had the most leisure time, with men consistently having slightly more free time than women across similar categories.
